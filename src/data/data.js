At this point in late 1996, what were his thoughts on his pal Diamond Dallas Page's career, and what about Eddie Guerrero, who'd been with the company for over a year? How did The Outsiders vs. The Faces Of Fear come about? Who on this card did Eric think had the worst wrestling gear he's ever seen?

WCW bounced back the next week but the following week was perhaps the most memorable moment in the Monday Night War - the \"DX Invasion\" of Nitro at the Norfolk Scope. Eric Bischoff and Conrad Thompson discuss the events leading up to that night, what most have forgotten about Nitro that night, the silly detail everyone likes to embellish, and how everyone remembers the events of that day. Kevin Nash, Booker T, and Chris Jericho have all told their story, but what does Eric remember? The result is a hilarious meltdown and shouting match between Eric and Conrad. In hindsight, what would Eric change? What didn't he like about it? What was the key to this entire angle that Eric thinks is really overlooked in the scheme of things? When the WCW offices were \"invaded\" later, Eric had to respond on air and did so with a challenge to Vince McMahon. Who did Eric consult with before doing so? What did Meltzer think of that move? Conrad breaks down the challenge on Nitro, McMahon's public statement on the website, and Eric reading the letter from the WWF's attorney on Thunder before discussing the silly Slamboree display. They close the story with the lawsuit that WCW filed against the WWF that really gets swept under the rug and then as your main event: Conrad calls \"BS\" on Eric's Bret Hart 1996 story from two weeks ago.

We will trace her steps from training, her debut, her first big breaks, and of course her recruitment to join the World Wrestling Federation. Who recruited her may surprise you!

Vince McMahon was in the fight of his life with the steroid trial, the business was much in transition where it had taken a dip, and this was the very first WrestleMania without Hulk Hogan. How did the trial effect his view of WrestleMania? Did it effect his booking of this show or his creativity in general? After the company took a dip in 1993, what did they change to return to profitability in 1994? How did Vince receive the news of Hogan negotiating with WCW? Did Vince consider working something out for Hogan to appear at this show? What was the deal with all of the celebrities? Bruce answers all of these questions before adding tidbits we've never heard before like Bret wanted to beat Owen, why Vince introduced Luger as World Champion at a house show, the finish of Savage-Crush, the backup plan if the ladder broke for Razor and Shawn, and so much more! Come along as we go back in time 25 years to revisit WRESTLEMANIA X!\n\n\n\n\nTONIGHT!

The top star can't wrestle so he fills his time investigating fake Santas... and defending future WWE Tag Team Champions. Plus the guys cover the Undertaker's health problems, the fall out from Bret Hart, the rumor and innuendo around Owen Hart sticking around, and so much more from the most interesting transition periods in the WWF!\n\n\n\n\nHave a question for our \"Foley Wins the Title\" episode next week?

The signature open still has the New Generation logo but boy are things different once the show starts. The WWF is coming under fire for \"going too far\" and there are even reported \"riots\" at live events. The top star can't wrestle so he fills his time investigating fake Santas... and defending future WWE Tag Team Champions. Plus the guys cover the Undertaker's health problems, the fall out from Bret Hart, the rumor and innuendo around Owen Hart sticking around, and so much more from the most interesting transition periods in the WWF!\n\n\n\n\nHave a question for our \"Foley Wins the Title\" episode next week?

Today Bruce takes us back to the beginning of his wrestling career all the way through today. From paying for his training to the legacy he has left and everything in between. Of course Christian's story is one of highs and lows. Bruce and Conrad examine his on-screen debut, the pairing with the Brood, whether or not that faction ended too quickly, what helped make his pairing with Edge, what writer had the most influence on his career as a tag wrestler, what PPV \"made\" their team, the infamous TLC matches people still talk about to this day, and of course the break up. How did they decide who was going to be the \"good guy\" in that story line? What did Vince see in Christian at that time? Did Vince really want Christian to cut his hair? Why didn't it happen? What's the rumor and innuendo about the blue dot? Of course the temper tantrums, the title runs, and the departure from WWE must be addressed. How did Vince react to Christian leaving? Did the TNA run help him upon his return? Why did Dixie Carter choose him to return to TNA in 2012 as a special deal with WWE over all other contracted WWE talent? What would Christian's career look like if there was never an Edge character?

        "description": "The Sable story is unlike any other. There's an old saying about keeping your wife away from the business but Marc Mero didn't listen. He brought her to meet Vince McMahon in 1996 and nothing was ever the same. Perhaps no one could have predicted the star she would become when she debuted at WrestleMania 12 with Hunter Hearst Helmsley. We can't help but cover the story of Marc Mero's push, IC run, and the horrible timing of his ACL injury. But that ACL injury presented an opportunity for Rena Mero to become the biggest female star in the company. What night does Bruce think \"made\" Sable in 1997? Fast forward a year later and she's making her debut as a wrestler at WrestleMania! Who has their first ever match at WrestleMania? SABLE! Of course that decision would come back to haunt the WWF when Sable sued them a year later. We discuss the way the \"boys\" treated Sable, her relationship with the other ladies (specifically Luna and Jackie), the heat that Mero took for his wife's push, whether or not it hurt Marc to take her powerbomb, the way the first Playboy deal came together, the controversial TSN appearance, the second offer from Playboy and how it changed everything, Sable asking for her release the first time, her demand to stop wrestling, her refusal to drop the belt, the unbelievable handwritten note, the conditional terms that the company granted for their release, her lawsuit in great detail, her appearance on Nitro and how it complicated things, the root of the lawsuit and why Vince didn't back down, a guess as to how it was settled, how Rena came back, why Mero did not, her relationship with Brock, the silliness of Vince and Sable, the crazy angles involving Linda and Stephanie, and how the relationship ended a second time. We also examine the many times Meltzer \"buried\" Sable, what Sable said no one wanted to \"boo,\" which Vince was responsible for her initial push, who really made room for her to be the top lady in the business, her legacy, why she isn't featured more in the WWE packages today, and whether or not she deserves to be in the Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\nRochester, New York, San Antonio, Winston Salem, LA, and Phoenix on sale now: www.BrucePrichard.com\n\n\n\n\nWatch Bruce answer your Sable questions LIVE next week: facebook.com/SomethingToWrestle\n\n\n\n\nAsk questions for the \"King of the Ring 1998\" episode right now: twitter.com/PrichardShow\n\n\n\n\nTees are at BrucePrichard.com and everything else is at BoxOfGimmicks.com\n\n\n\n\nSave Yourself Some Money: www.SaveWithBruce.com\n\n\n\n\nAnd don't miss our \"Big Evil\" Undertaker episode next Wednesday on the WWE Network!\n\n\n\n\nSupport our sponsors and visit lightstream.com/wrestle to get .5% off of your next loan and text SLAM to 79-79-79 for a FREE 30 day supply of Ageless Male Max, just pay shipping and handling",

With the Federal investigation looming, Vince McMahon steps down as President of Titan Sports after 12 years in the role, Tom Cole's story and the \"ring boy scandal\" continues to twist in the media, Hulk Hogan is working with NJPW but he's the WWF Champion and he wants to leave to do TV full time, Bret Hart feels like his opportunity to be the top guy was taken from him by a \"half-in\" Hogan, Yokozuna is the monster heel Vince loves, and somebody needs him at SummerSlam. But wasn't Hart-Hogan the plan at SummerSlam? What subtle hints were dropped on this broadcast and what \"out\" did Vince leave himself with the booking? Of course Bruce discusses the incredible performance by Bret Hart, a rusty Mr. Perfect who doesn't look rusty at all, a hot angle with Lawler to finish the show. the silly photographer outfit, and the weird transitional period within the company where stars from the \"golden era\" like Hacksaw Duggan are still in the company when guys like Razor, Diesel, and Shawn are coming into their own. And oh yeah, the guys discuss that \"European tour\" that got them into the worst fight in show history back on the WrestleMania IX episode.\n\n\n\n\nChicago, Pittsburgh, Rochester, New York, San Antonio and LA on sale now: www.BrucePrichard.com\n\n\n\n\nAsk questions for the \"Bad Blood 2003\" episode right now: www.facebook.com/SomethingToWrestle\n\n\n\n\nVote in our upcoming polls: www.twitter.com/PrichardShow\n\n\n\n\nTees are at BrucePrichard.com and everything else is at BoxOfGimmicks.com\n\n\n\n\nSave Yourself Some Money: www.SaveWithBruce.com\n\n\n\n\nAnd find out if we still have a video show next Wednesday on the WWE Network!",

With the Federal investigation looming, Vince McMahon steps down as President of Titan Sports after 12 years in the role, Tom Cole's story and the \"ring boy scandal\" continues to twist in the media, Hulk Hogan is working with NJPW but he's the WWF Champion and he wants to leave to do TV full time, Bret Hart feels like his opportunity to be the top guy was taken from him by a \"half-in\" Hogan, Yokozuna is the monster heel Vince loves, and somebody needs him at SummerSlam. But wasn't Hart-Hogan the plan at SummerSlam? What subtle hints were dropped on this broadcast and what \"out\" did Vince leave himself with the booking? Of course Bruce discusses the incredible performance by Bret Hart, a rusty Mr. Perfect who doesn't look rusty at all, a hot angle with Lawler to finish the show. the silly photographer outfit, and the weird transitional period within the company where stars from the \"golden era\" like Hacksaw Duggan are still in the company when guys like Razor, Diesel, and Shawn are coming into their own. And oh yeah, the guys discuss that \"European tour\" that got them into the worst fight in show history back on the WrestleMania IX episode.\n\n\n\n\nChicago, Pittsburgh, Rochester, New York, San Antonio and LA on sale now: www.BrucePrichard.com\n\n\n\n\nAsk questions for the \"Bad Blood 2003\" episode right now: www.facebook.com/SomethingToWrestle\n\n\n\n\nVote in our upcoming polls: www.twitter.com/PrichardShow\n\n\n\n\nTees are at BrucePrichard.com and everything else is at BoxOfGimmicks.com\n\n\n\n\nSave Yourself Some Money: www.SaveWithBruce.com\n\n\n\n\nAnd find out if we still have a video show next Wednesday on the WWE Network!",

This is the most \"stacked\" roster in company history. Jeff Hardy, Batista, Randy Orton, Kevin Nash, Goldberg, and John Cena are all on the roster but not on the show.

Learn about the plan to push Scott to the moon as a single star, what kept Vince from getting on board, their quick ascent to the title, and the reasons for their short run in the WWF. Conrad and Bruce also cover the entire run of Big Poppa Pump in the WWE; including why he was an ideal adversary for Triple H at the time, why he didn't sign when WCW was bought out, how he wanted to change the finish to the title match on the last Nitro, and much more! Also, a great discussion and insight on the process and influence of Jim Johnston, the recently released WWF/WWE music master, on this \"Steinerized\" version of Something to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard.

Conrad and Bruce also cover the entire run of Big Poppa Pump in the WWE; including why he was an ideal adversary for Triple H at the time, why he didn't sign when WCW was bought out, how he wanted to change the finish to the title match on the last Nitro, and much more! Also, a great discussion and insight on the process and influence of Jim Johnston, the recently released WWF/WWE music master, on this \"Steinerized\" version of Something to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard. Holler if you hear me!",

        "description": "The business was changing in 1996 and Bret Hart was at the center of it all for the World Wrestling Federation. Bill Watts is out and the decision is made to make Shawn Michaels \"the guy.\" Soon after, Diesel and Razor leave for greener pastures creating a perfect storm for Bret Hart to the subject of the greatest bidding war in the history of the business. Bret stays loyal for less money but finds that this isn't the same WWF he left a year before. How did the Ultimate Warrior potentially change everything for Bret? What did Bret think of Shawn losing his smile? How did Vince convince Bret to become a heel? What was with the cursing on RAW before WrestleMania 13? Bret doubled down and the Hart Foundation's angle became the hottest in the company. While feuding on camera with Steve Austin, Bret's real issue was with Shawn Michaels. We address Sunny days, the wheelchair promo to end RAW, the fight before RAW, the \"girly\" magazine comments, and how \"working the boys\" turned into a shoot. What fault did Bret deserve in this? What single conversation could have caused the Montreal Screwjob? On one of the most historic nights of Mick Foley and Steve Austin's career, Bret learns his contract is about to be breached because Vince can't afford him. When did Vince regret giving Bret that contract? Did Vince change his mind and tell Bret he found the money? What did Bret's agent say? What did Bret ask Bischoff for? When Bret got the offer, how did Vince respond? Once the deal was done, how did word get out? What did Bret write in his column that week that directly contradicts what Bret wrote in his book? Why did Vince write an open letter to the fans before the Survivor Series? Who suggested the screwjob? What offer did Vince make to Bret for the night before that Bret turned down? Which of the boys tried to warn Bret? Who knew the night of? When did Earl see Bret again? We've heard Bret's account of punching Vince but what really happened in that room? Who tried to quit in protest? Who came up with \"Bret Screwed Bret\" for the interview with JR? Bret's final two years in the company saw him put on some of his best matches ever, he certainly give his strongest promos of his career during this time, and was involved in one of the hottest angles in company history. Does the screwjob tarnish all of that? Decide for yourself in our longest episode ever in what we believe is the best podcast there is, was, or ever will be!

        "itunes:summary": "The business was changing in 1996 and Bret Hart was at the center of it all for the World Wrestling Federation. Bill Watts is out and the decision is made to make Shawn Michaels \"the guy.\" Soon after, Diesel and Razor leave for greener pastures creating a perfect storm for Bret Hart to the subject of the greatest bidding war in the history of the business. Bret stays loyal for less money but finds that this isn't the same WWF he left a year before. How did the Ultimate Warrior potentially change everything for Bret? What did Bret think of Shawn losing his smile? How did Vince convince Bret to become a heel? What was with the cursing on RAW before WrestleMania 13? Bret doubled down and the Hart Foundation's angle became the hottest in the company. While feuding on camera with Steve Austin, Bret's real issue was with Shawn Michaels. We address Sunny days, the wheelchair promo to end RAW, the fight before RAW, the \"girly\" magazine comments, and how \"working the boys\" turned into a shoot. What fault did Bret deserve in this? What single conversation could have caused the Montreal Screwjob? On one of the most historic nights of Mick Foley and Steve Austin's career, Bret learns his contract is about to be breached because Vince can't afford him. When did Vince regret giving Bret that contract? Did Vince change his mind and tell Bret he found the money? What did Bret's agent say? What did Bret ask Bischoff for? When Bret got the offer, how did Vince respond? Once the deal was done, how did word get out? What did Bret write in his column that week that directly contradicts what Bret wrote in his book? Why did Vince write an open letter to the fans before the Survivor Series? Who suggested the screwjob? What offer did Vince make to Bret for the night before that Bret turned down? Which of the boys tried to warn Bret? Who knew the night of? When did Earl see Bret again? We've heard Bret's account of punching Vince but what really happened in that room? Who tried to quit in protest? Who came up with \"Bret Screwed Bret\" for the interview with JR? Bret's final two years in the company saw him put on some of his best matches ever, he certainly give his strongest promos of his career during this time, and was involved in one of the hottest angles in company history. Does the screwjob tarnish all of that? Decide for yourself in our longest episode ever in what we believe is the best podcast there is, was, or ever will be!

They did try to rekindle the Ric Flair-Terry Funk magic from 1989 and had a couple of surprising appearances, but it all fell flat.\nJoin Conrad and Tony to a journey back to Y2K.

Tony and Conrad are in rare form with the silliness on this episode so fire up the WWE Network to find Clash of the Champions from April 2, 1989, press mute, and let the good times roll!\n\nHave a question for our \"Spring Stampede 1997\" episode?

No, it is the bipolar early 90's WCW, as Tony and Conrad cover WrestleWar 1991 featuring what many consider the best Wargames of all time, as well as many peculiar matches involving some of the greatest of all time. Is it Brian Pillman's coming out party, or Scott Steiner's? How did Tony know before almost anyone else that Dusty was coming back? Why did Larry Zbysko replace Double A in the main event? These are some of the questions answered as Tony recalls EVERYTHING from this era of WCW and provides maybe the best insight in the history of our fine show, on the, another fine episode of What Happened When Mondays with Tony Schiavone and Conrad Thompson!\n\n      ",
